# YetAnotherScienceKeepyUpy

Welcome to **YetAnotherScienceKeepyUpy** – the web app that keeps your science game in the air! 🧪🏐

## What is this?

A modern, Material-inspired web app for searching scientific topics, fetching recent PubMed papers, and getting AI-powered summaries. It's like juggling research, but with fewer dropped balls and more abstracts.

## Features

- 🔍 Search for any topic and get the latest PubMed papers (no need to comb through journals manually!)
- 📄 Click on a paper title to instantly reveal the abstract (no more "abstract" thinking)
- 🧠 Enter your OpenAI API key to get a GPT-powered summary of the papers, formatted in beautiful markdown (because science should be both smart and pretty)
- ⏳ Progress bar and spinner animations so you know your science is in motion
- 📝 See exactly what is sent to OpenAI, so you can keep your research transparent (no smoke and mirrors)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (for best results, use a local server)
2. Enter a topic, set the number of results, and (optionally) your OpenAI API key
3. Click **Search** and watch the science roll in!
4. Click paper titles to expand abstracts, and check out the AI summary above the results

## Requirements

- Modern web browser
- (Optional) OpenAI API key for summaries (get yours at https://platform.openai.com/)

## Why "Keepy Upy"?

Because science is all about keeping up with the latest research – and this app helps you keep all those papers in the air, without dropping your curiosity!
